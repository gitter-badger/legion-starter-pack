Getting Started With Legion
===========================

**Thank you for your patience while we set up new documentation. Anything you
find here may be incomplete.**

This is the homepage for the legion-starter-pack. If you just want to jump in,
clone this repository and edit the `testcase.js` file.

	git clone https://github.com/lane-webperformance/legion-starter-pack.git

But before you do, the legion-starter-pack also contains examples and
documentation to help you succeed.
